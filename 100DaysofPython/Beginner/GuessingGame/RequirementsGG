The software shall display an ascii art at the beginning
The game shall begin with the following text:"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100."
The game shall display the correct answer as displayed here: "Psssst, the correct answer is 'correct answer'"
The game shall ask for a difficulty level
The game shall choose a random number between 1 and 100
The user shall be able to choose between easy and hard
If the user chose easy the software shall let the user input 10 numbers
If the user chose easy the software shall print "You have 10 attempts remaining to guess the number."
if the user chose hard the software shall let the user input 5 numbers
if the user chose hard the software shall print "You have 5 attempts remaining to guess the number."
Until the user inputs a number the software shall display "Make a guess"
The software shall read the users input
If the users input was lower than the goal number, the software shall display "Too low" "Guess again." "You have '-1' attempts remaining to guess the number."(-1 = easy 10-1 = 9; hard 5-1 = 4 and so on)
If the users input was higher than the goal number, the software shall display "Too high" "Guess again." "You have '-1' attempts remaining to guess the number."(-1 = easy 10-1 = 9;  
If the remaining attempts == 0, the software shall print "No attempts remaining." "Game Over!"
If the user guesses the number, the software shall print "You got it! The answer was 'goal number'."
if remaining attempts == 0 or user guessed the number, the software shall print "Do you want to try again 'yes'  or 'no' ?"
If the user inputs 'yes' the game shall restart and generate a new random number between 1-100
